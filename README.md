# ApplyAjax

Abstraction of ajax-requests to the server + templating of the received data. 

Ajax requests are based on the fetch method that appeared in non-standard JavaScript. Standardization follows the same working principle of a PHP templating engine [PQSkaTpl](https://github.com/avtomon/PQSkaTpl).
