# ApplyAjax

Abstraction of ajax-requests to the server + template of the received data.

#### Installation

``
composer reqire avtomon/applyajax.js
``
<br>

#### Description

Ajax-queries are based on the fetch method, which appeared in the not-for-nothing in JavaScript. Templating also repeats the principle of the PHP-template engine [PQSkaTpl](https://github.com/avtomon/PQSkaTpl).

<b> Note: </b>
If you plan to independently decompose the project and build it with the <i> build.sh </i> script, you will need to install <b> Gulp </b> and its plugins specified in the <i> init.sh </i> script in global scope, and why execute the <i> init.sh </i> script for linking. Or to establish all the dependencies directly in the project.
