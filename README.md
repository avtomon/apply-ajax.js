# ApplyAjax

Abstraction of ajax-requests to the server + template of the received data.

Ajax-queries are based on the fetch method, which appeared in the not-for-nothing in JavaScript. Templating also repeats the principle of the PHP-template engine [PQSkaTpl](https://github.com/avtomon/PQSkaTpl).
